# Data-Wrangling-with-MongoDB
A data wrangling project as part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nano degree using python and MongoDB.
This project involves two phases primarily:
  Data cleaning using Python. Dataset in the form of XML document is taken as an input and then audited and cleaned according to some standards and pre-defined metrics for ingestion into database.
  The cleaned data is then ingested into MongoDB and some preliminary statistics are reported using MongoDB's aggregated framework mostly. 
  A final report is prepared highlighting all of these steps. 
  The data used is openstreetmap information of an area where I live - i.e. Bengaluru.
